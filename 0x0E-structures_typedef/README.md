# In this topic we going through out Structures and typedef
I will keep updating the Repo 
<mark>General</mark>
- What are structures, when, why and how to use them
- How to use typedef
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are printf, malloc, free and exit.
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
